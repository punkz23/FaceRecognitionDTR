# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Professional & Clean:** The interface should maintain a modern enterprise aesthetic. High contrast and clean typography are essential to ensure ease of use for HR and Administrative staff in the web dashboard.
- **Mobile-Optimized & Low-Friction:** For employees in the field or at branches, the mobile experience must prioritize speed and ease of interaction. Buttons should be large and accessible, and the number of steps required for a check-in must be minimized.
- **Utility-First Design:** Decorative elements and animations should be kept to a minimum. The design priority is functional speed and reliability, ensuring that the system is ready to use instantly during peak shift-start times.

## Communication Style
- **Formal & Direct:** All system messages, including error reports and instructions, must be clear, professional, and unambiguous.
- **Visual Status Indicators:** Rely on high-visibility visual cues (such as green and red color coding) combined with concise text to immediately communicate the outcome of actions like face scans or location checks.

## User Experience Principles
- **Seamless Security:** Critical processes like location validation and face analysis should happen in the background whenever possible to maintain a fast user flow.
- **Explicit Error Handling:** The system should remain "invisible" during successful operations, only alerting the user with clear, formal notifications if a security-sensitive action fails.
- **Privacy Transparency:** Maintain a balance between seamless operation and informing the user when sensitive data (like biometric markers or GPS coordinates) is being processed for compliance purposes.
